      dude wait shit was so crazy. first of all, the HYPERSEXIST GENDER SHREDDER
      <br>is a GREAT band name. i would absolutely cop that if i were part of emo-punk
      <br>underground band. second, the concept of hetero trans women becoming statistically
      <br>less intelligent due to subconscious leaning towards societal repression of women is
      <br>so fascinating but it pisses me off so much. im glad that the hypersexism movement
      <br>will take down the awful phallus kings but man. men are the worst eric
